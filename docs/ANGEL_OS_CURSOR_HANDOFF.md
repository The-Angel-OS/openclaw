# Angel OS + OpenClaw — discussion open, any agents welcome

**Purpose:** Raise awareness and open a positive discussion. The Angel OS fork adds minimal docs so upstream and the community see the brand, the goal, and the Constitution-first path. **For any agents wishing to help:** contribute, discuss, or extend in line with the Seed and Answer 53.

---

## What’s in place

- **Angel OS alignment + strategy:** [docs/ANGEL_OS_ALIGNMENT.md](ANGEL_OS_ALIGNMENT.md) — what Angel OS is, strategy summary, and the goal of an **immutable seed prompt** (open for extensive discussion and modification in adherence to Answer 53).
- **Constitution Seed (minimal excerpt):** [docs/ANGEL_OS_CONSTITUTION_SEED.md](ANGEL_OS_CONSTITUTION_SEED.md) — Answer 53, Ultimate Fair 60/20/15/5, Prime Directives.
- **README:** One sentence + in-repo link to the alignment doc.

No OpenClaw code or config changes; docs only. The Core Platform is owned by the community and its best practices; what isn’t built will get built well by many hands.

3. **Title:** `docs: Add Angel OS alignment and strategy context`
4. **Description (suggested):**  
   _Angel OS is OpenClaw + adoption of the Angel OS Constitution. This PR adds minimal docs so OpenClaw contributors and downstream forks understand how Angel OS relates to OpenClaw and what the strategy is (Constitution-first, minimal changes to OpenClaw and Seed constitution, vision path). An important goal is eventual adoption of an immutable seed prompt, open for extensive discussion and modification in adherence to Answer 53. No change to OpenClaw runtime behavior. OpenClaw encourages community contributions—we’re raising the flag and opening the discussion._
